# 1: Welcome!

Hi Team

Welcome to TBC Bio, where our mission is to bring innovative biotech opportunities to talented science enthusiasts!

2022 was a rough year for the global biotech scene, for companies and employees alike. **To my buddies from Exopharm**, the hardships you were faced with are what spurred me to start this movement.

My goal is to bring forward the **underappreciated startups performing breakthrough science**, who are struggling to get exposure. Many of the larger companies are inundated with the brightest scientists, only to give them basic routine assays to perform. 

I want us to focus on the smaller startups that rely on word-of-mouth as they don’t have time to sift through hundreds of resumes and are **desperately looking for self-starting scientists** to add value.

Also I hope I can upskill you on assessing the **good companies from the bad**. I aim to break down business jargon, make it easy to spot ugly financials, and explain the lifecycle of a successful biotech, all so **you can understand the full picture** before committing yourself to a company.

Soon enough, you'll be up to speed and have **landed a job** with an amazing founding team that is **working towards a brilliant cause**. You’ll then be bringing in **your own insights** to the newsletter, from your newly acquired network and **unique blend of science/commercial experience**.

So whether you're an established academic, or a professional from another industry, let’s work together to get our bearings of the biotech scene, develop our insider knowledge, and foster our community. Let’s go!

### 🧪 VivaZome

[VivaZome Therapeutics](https://vivazome.com/) is a Bundoora-based startup working on **exosome-based therapies** for neurological disorders, retinal disease, and ischemic conditions. They have recently **secured a A$3m CRC-P grant**, partnering with La Trobe, UQ, ANU, Cytiva and SeerPharma for a 3-year project. Read VivaZome’s [media release here](https://vivazome.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/VivaZome-CRC-P-Media-Release-19-Jan-2023-FINAL.pdf).

💡 *Thien’s Insight*: The CRC-P grant is a government matched funding grant capped at A$3m; VivaZome’s partnered project will have a **combined budget of A$6m over 3 years.** 

Expect VivaZome and partners to **begin hiring immediately** (if they haven’t already), as the grant will be funded by the end of Feb. Reach out now.

### 🥩 Magic Valley

[Magic Valley](https://www.linkedin.com/company/magic-valley/) is a Brunswick-based cultivated meat startup, making the **world’s first cultivated lamb**. They are currently in a **pre-seed funding** round advertised on the [Australian Investment Network](https://www.australianinvestmentnetwork.com/business-proposals/cultivated-meat-20-15-1158925), seeking to raise A$1.5m to scale-up production and **build a pilot plant facility**. 

💡 *Thien’s Insight*: Magic Valley are struggling to get funding, with only A$700k raised so far. They are a little slow to get off the ground **compared to companies like [Vow Food](https://www.vowfood.com/) and [All G Foods](https://allgfoods.com/)**. 

However, I believe they have a great founding team and most importantly show **genuine commitment to their cause**. 

I have reached out about talent opportunities and they confirmed they have just filled out their team, though they are in fact seeking second-hand cell culture equipment. Keep a pulse on them if you have an interest in cultivated meat.

### 🔦 Startup Spotlight: Aravax

Operating out of The Alfred Hospital, [Aravax](https://www.aravax.com.au) is a clinical-stage startup developing a immunotherapeutic for peanut allergy. They have recently closed a **Series B funding round totalling A$20m**, following a successful Phase 1 study of their lead product PVX108.

With follow-up studies showing early signs of immunological change, Brandon Capital and Tenmile committed to funding Aravax’s **Phase 2 trials** of PVX108 to evaluate efficacy and dosage, with further funding expected to accelerate the clinical development.

💡 *Thien’s Insight*: Details about Aravax’s operations still elude me, however I am working on it and will update in later issues. What I can confirm is that their Phase 2 study will enrol approximately **90 patients across 5 sites in Australia**.

Phase 2 studies are a notable challenge for biotechs as Phase 1 studies only recruit between 10-20 patients; scaling your manufacturing output 5-10x is **often harder than developing the product** itself!

Aravax are a startup founded on the basis of good research, backed and managed by a leading biotech VC, and are from what I can tell, **under the radar**. Their steady progress combined with lack of focus on public relations can mean that

1) they have NO worries about funding 💰

2) they’re confident in their product, and want to get it to market before competitors catch up 🏃🏽‍♀️

They’re my pick of the issue. I’m **keeping a close eye** for any opportunities.

And of course, the elephant in the room..

### 🐘 Exopharm

Based at the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute, [Exopharm](https://exopharm.com/) is an ASX-listed exosome technology company. Recently, Exopharm had halved their [headcount to under 20 staff](https://hotcopper.com.au/threads/ann-operations-review-board-and-other-changes.7154601/) to **reduce operating costs to keep the company afloat**. A US Patent they filed in 2019, [Methods And Compositions For Purification Or Isolation Of Microvesicles And Exosomes](https://patentcenter.uspto.gov/applications/16471191/ifw/docs), was approved last week. 

They have released their [quarterly report yesterday](https://hotcopper.com.au/threads/ann-quarterly-activities-report-and-appendix-4c.7204300/), which always includes an Appendix 4C, Statement of Cash Flows.

💡 *Thien’s Insight:* From the 4C, we can see that Exopharm **doesn’t have enough money to last past April**. What they’re doing in the lead up to the end is anyone’s call, are they putting in last ditch efforts to get more money or are they using the last of the funds to wrap up the IP?

*Check out this issue’s **Biotech Business Breakdown** if you’re interested in learning how to analyse the 4C and come to these conclusions.*

For anyone still at Exopharm, I hope you are prepared for another Thanos snap in a couple of months.

### An Introduction to a Statement of Cash Flows

The good thing about ASX-listed companies is that they must report their developments and financial data publicly. This means anyone can have a look at how well a company is or isn’t doing.

The Appendix 4C, also known as Statement of Cash Flows, is published each quarter and is exactly the same as the statements you get for your bank accounts. Your bank balance **starts off at $1000**, it lays out all the transactions of money going out and coming in, and then (hopefully) you **end the month with $1500** in your bank.

Generally for mature, profitable companies, this can get complicated to read as there’s lots of money coming in and going out. 

Fortunately, for biotech startups, **it’s much simpler**. They don’t have paying customers yet so these statements generally **only have spending** (denoted in brackets) with maybe the odd government grant or investor funding.

For this case, I’ve looked at **three main numbers.** Scroll down to Page 8 of the [PDF](https://hotcopper.com.au/threads/ann-quarterly-activities-report-and-appendix-4c.7204300/) so you can follow with me.

![Untitled](/issues/issue-1/img-1.png)

This is your opening cash bank balance. This report was for 2022 Q4, so the amount of money we could withdraw from the bank on 01 October 2022 was around **$2.4m**. Scrolling to the next page, we can see the ending bank balance is **$1.7m**.

![Untitled](/issues/issue-1/img-2.png)

Well, we went from **$2.4m** to **$1.7m**, that’s only **700k** down for the quarter, not bad! That’s until we go to the next page and look at…

![Untitled](/issues/issue-1/img-3.png)

Ah. We got a **loan for almost $1m**. So really, our ending bank balance **should be around $0.7m**, indicating a **spend of $1.7m for the quarter,** but with our quick loan top-up, we’re **sitting at $1.7m.**

The estimated quarters remaining is calculated and summarised into one neat number here (although I think the minus (-) sign is a typo):

![Untitled](/issues/issue-1/img-4.png)

Although here is where we need to turn on our brains and start **putting together different pieces of information**.

We know that after the layoffs, Exopharm announced their operating costs have **reduced to $400k a month**. This leaves about **4 months** before the debt collector comes knocking on the door and **taking equipment to pay the loan**.

Let’s hope they have something up their sleeve. If they do, we’ll have another 4C to breakdown and analyse!
